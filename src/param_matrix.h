* SOFTWARE BRIEF DESCRIPTION: The ProSe-PA is a software for simulating the hydro-biogeochemical functioning of rivers, particularly heavily urbanised rivers, and streams. The sofware can
* operate in two modes: direct calculation or data assimilation.
*
* In direct calculation mode, based on a semi-implicit Eulerian numerical scheme, the software simulates the functioning of the water column in contact with a benthic compartment made up of unconsolidated
* sediments and periphyton (librive library). It can be used to simulate the anthropisation of environments, through the explicit representation of developments such as navigation dams, sluice
* gates and river navigation, as well as discharges into the environment, such as those from wastewater treatment plants or combined sewer overflows.
* The software explicitly simulates the growth of micro-organisms in the water column and in the benthic compartment, enabling the carbon, oxygen and nutrient (nitrogen, phosphrus, silica) cycles
* associated with these biological processes to be quantified (librive library). Water temperature is also simulated by the software (libseb library), as are particulate and dissolved exchanges
* between the water column and the benthic compartment. The software can simulate 1D, pseudo-2D hydraulics of river and streams (discharge, water height) using the libhyd library. The advection-dispersion 
* process is simulated using libttc library.
* 
* In data assimilation mode, ProSe-PA includes two filters for assimilating high frequency dissolved oxygen data. These two filters are a particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter.
*
* ANSI C software developed at the Geosciences and geoengineering Department, joint research center of Mines Paris-PSL and ARMINES, Fontainebleau, France. The code is based on the coupling 
* of 12 libraries developed also at the Geosciences and geoengineering Department, mostly in ANSI C: libprint, libts, libpc, libchronos, libio, libhyd, libtube, libttc, librive, libseb, libmb, scripts.
